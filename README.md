## Challenges Faced and How it was overcome
| Challenge Faced | Method to overcome |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| Writing test case where the function doesn't take arguments | Made those function to return SUCCESS or FAILURE |

### Tool usage
* **Unit test** cases for each function.
* **Makefile** for **compilation**, **running test** cases and additional targets.
* **Documentation** using **Doxygen**.
* **cppcheck** and **Valgrind** tools to analyze the code.
