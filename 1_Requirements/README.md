# Requirements
## Introduction
 * Everyday we come across a situation where we have to do some mathematical operations of any sort whether its a normal basic calculation,unit conversion,temperature conversion,bitwise operation,digital storage unit conversion or sometimes we may look for our body mass index.Then in these cases we have to google or find some other device for our solution.So in order to make a better solution for this I have put all these basic operations at one place so that user doesn't have to move here and there whenever they need to perform these operations. 
 * In this project i have implemented all the concepts of C programming also included unit test files, Makefile.

## Research
### One Stop Solution For Major Mathematical Operations
Mathematics makes our life orderly and prevents chaos.
Mathematics is the cradle of all creations, without which the world cannot move an inch. Be it a cook or a farmer, a carpenter or a mechanic, a shopkeeper or a doctor, an engineer or a scientist, a musician or a magician, everyone needs mathematics in their day-to-day life. Even insects use mathematics in their everyday life for existence.

Everyday almost every individual encounter a situation where he/she has to perform a mathematical calculation or conversion from one unit to other.There is a lack of resources for these major operations at one place.

### Benefits
One stop solution brings some of the major mathematical challenges/operations/conversions at one place. Here are 
just a few of them:

### Calculator
A calculator that will help you for addition,substraction,multiplication,division,modulus,power and factorial operations.

### Bitwise Calculator
It will help to perform Bitwise AND, Bitwise OR, Bitwise XOR , Bitwise NOT, Left shift and Right Shift on decimal integers

### Complex Calculator
Computes sum ,addition , substraction and division of two complex numbers

### BMI Calculator
BMI Calculator which takes height in meter and weight in Kg and outputs your BMI.

### Temperature Unit Converter
It contains function to convert all temperature units i.e celsius to fahrenheit,celsius to kelvin,fahrenheit to celsius,fahrenheit to kelvin

### Digital Storage Converter
Gives solution for all types of Data Storage unit conversion(bits,bytes,kilobytes,megabytes,gigabytes,terabytes)

### Unit Converter
Function for area calculation and other major unit converters

## Cost and Features with Time
| Time | Feature | Cost |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1800-1900  |  Different devices for different operations such as calculator | $10 |
| 1900-2000 | Devices that could many operations at one place such as scientific calculator | $50 |
| 2000-present | Software solution were made to cater these operations and functions| Negligible cost |
